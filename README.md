# HTTP-DL

Simple tool to download a file via HTTP.
Very basic, can be used as template/boilerplate code.

## About:
Downloads file via HTTP and solely via HTTP. Filename is based on the URL which is given.

For example:
```
http://www.example.org/stuff/awesome-script.py
http://www.example.org/stuff/no-file-extension
http://example.org
```
Will give you the following files and extensions:
```
awesome-script.py
no-file-extension
example.org
```

Obviously could be better, but this is done simply for practice and learning. Don't recommend using it, just use wget to grab stuff instead or your favorite download tool.
